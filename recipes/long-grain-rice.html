      <h2>What is long grain rice?</h2>
      <p>If all you need is a simple bowl of fluffy rice to serve with dinner, this is the easiest, most foolproof method that I know.</p>
      <p>
        You don't need measuring cups, a recipe, or even a specific water-to-rice ratio -- fill a pot with water, add the rice, bring it to a boil, then simmer until
        the rice is tender. Drain the rice, return it to the pot, and let it steam in its own residual heat until you're ready to serve.

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup long-grain white or brown rice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt (optional)</li>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <!--Step 1-->
        <li><strong>Fill a pot with water and add the rice:</strong></li>
        <p>
          The rice should be covered by several inches of water (use a 1:4 ratio of rice to water if you're nervous). If using, add at least 1 teaspoon of salt per
          cup of rice. Stir a few times to make sure the rice and water are mixed.
        </p>

        <!--Step 2-->
        <li><strong>Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer:</strong></li>
        <p>Let the water come to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat until it maintains a gentle bubbling simmer.</p>

        <!--Step 3-->
        <li><strong>Cook the rice until barely tender:</strong></li>
        <p>
          White rice will cook in roughly 10 to 15 minutes. Brown rice will cook in roughly 20 to 30 minutes. Stir the rice a few times during cooking, when you
          remember. Taste it as you get toward the end of cooking to test its doneness. It's ready when tender and no longer crunchy, but still a touch too firm for
          your liking.

        <!--Step 4-->
        <li><strong>Drain the rice:</strong></li>
        <p>Set the strainer over your sink or a large bowl and strain the rice and cooking liquid. (The cooking liquid can be saved for other cooking projects.)</p>
        <p>Shake the strainer a few times to fully drain the rice</p>
        <img src="/odin-recipes/img/lgr4.jpg" />
        <!--step 5-->
        <li><strong>Return to the pot, cover and let stand:</strong></li>
        <p>
          Immediately after straining, while the rice is still hot and steamy, transfer the rice back to the pot and cover with the lid. Let stand off the heat, for
          10 to 15 minutes. The steam from hot rice trapped in the pan will finish cooking the rice and help give it a perfect texture.

        <!--step 6-->
        <li><strong>Fluff and serve:</strong></li>
        <p>Uncover the rice, fluff with a fork, and server.</p>
