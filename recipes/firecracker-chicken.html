      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ol>
        <!--Step 1-->
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven to 400Â°F and prep the sauce:</strong></li>
        <p>Stir together the sauce ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside.</p>

        <!--Step 2-->
        <li><strong>Prep the chicken:</strong></li>
        <p>In a bowl or large plastic bag, combine the cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Add chicken and toss to coat well.</p>
        <p>Whisk together the eggs in a medium mixing bowl. Line a plate with paper towels. Arrange everything near your stove.</p>
        <img src="/odin-recipes/img/fcc2.jpg">
        <!--Step 3-->
        <li><strong>Fry the chicken on the stovetop:</strong></li>
        <p>In a large, deep skillet or wok, warm the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until a flick of water sizzles on contact.</p>
        <p>
          As soon as the oil is hot, transfer the coated chicken to the bowl with the eggs and toss to coat well. Scoop out the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon,
          allowing any excess egg to drain off, and transfer the chicken to the skillet in an even layer.
        </p>
        <p>Cook for about 3 minutes per side until a crust forms and the chicken is a light tan color. The chicken will not be cooked through at this point.</p>

        <!--Step 4-->
        <li><strong>Sauce the chicken:</strong></li>
        <p>
          When chicken is done, remove it from the skillet with a slotted spoon and transfer it to the plate lined with paper towels to drain off any excess oil.
        </p>
        <p>Transfer to a 9x13 baking dish. Add sauce and toss to combine.</p>

        <!--Step 5-->
        <li><strong>Bake the chicken:</strong></li>
        <p>
          Bake chicken for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring halfway through to ensure even cooking. When the chicken is done, it should be cooked through and the sauce
          will thicken and turn into a glaze coating the chicken.
        </p>
        <!--Step 6-->
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong></li>
        <p>Serve chicken with cooked rice garnished with scallions.</p>
